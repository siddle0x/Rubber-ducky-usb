Imagine plugging in a seemingly innocent USB drive into a computer and installing backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials.

With a few well crafted keystrokes anything is possible. If only you had a few minutes, a photographic memory and perfect typing accuracy.

The USB Rubber Ducky injects keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating the inherent trust computers have in humans by posing as a keyboard.

Inventing keystroke injection in 2010, the USB Rubber Ducky became the must-have pentest tool. With a covert design and simple "Ducky Script" language, this bad USB infiltrates systems and imaginations the world over.
